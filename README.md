# Final Year Project - Delve - Software Component Analysis via SBOMs and Vulnerability Management

Delve is a secure, cloud-native API designed for **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)** management and **vulnerability tracking**.  
It enables users to generate, upload, analyze, and organize SBOMs, while automatically scanning for vulnerabilities across open-source and containerized software artifacts.

Built using **Node.js**, **AWS Services**, **Syft**, and **Grype**, Delve empowers software teams to improve their supply chain security posture.

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

To launch the Delve application, the following steps must be performed:

### 1. Install Requirements

Ensure that **Terraform** is installed and configured on your host system.  
You can install Terraform via:

```bash
brew install terraform
```

Fetch the latest copy of this code repository through cloning it or via HTTPS:
```
git clone https://github.com/DylBP/SBOM-FYP.git

https://github.com/DylBP/SBOM-FYP/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
```

The AWS CLI must be installed also, and you must have your environment set up using `aws configure` with your region set to `eu-west-1`.

### 2. Prepare Infrastructure Variables

Navigate to the `/infra` directory in the project.

Create a file named **`terraform.tfvars`** with the following content, replacing the placeholder values with your own:

```hcl
# This AMI and the associated snapshot has been made publicly available for this project.
ami_id         = "ami-0f16b8a97a0fe723f"
key_name       = "<Your AWS Key>"
instance_type  = "t2.micro"
vpc_id         = "vpc-xxxYourVPCIDxxx"
public_subnets = ["subnet-xxxYourSubnet1IDxxx", "subnet-xxxYourSubnet2IDxxx"]
```

‚ö†‚ö†‚ö† Your AWS region must be `eu-west-1` to be able to access this AMI. ‚ö†‚ö†‚ö†

### 3. Initialise and Apply Terraform Configuration

From the `/infra` directory, run the following commands:
```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

Infrastructure will be provisioned:
- An EC2 instance will be launched and bootstrapped within your environment
- The user data fetches the latest codebase from GitHub and starts the Delve API

The instance should not be required to be SSH'd into manually unless for troubleshooting.

### 4. Frontend

Navigate to `/frontend/delve-frontend/` and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Navigate to `/frontend/delve-frontend/api/`, and modify the file named `axios.js` such that
the ALB DNS name from earlier is the base URL.

---

### 5. Accessing the Application

Once the backend is deployed and the frontend is running, you can access the Delve application in your browser at the localhost URL.

---

## üßπ Cleanup Instructions
To destroy the AWS infrastructure and remove all provisioned resources:

```bash
cd infra
terraform destroy
```

This will terminate and destroy all provisioned resources.

--- 

## üõ† Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|:-----|:---------|
| **AMI not launching / not found** | Ensure your AWS region is `eu-west-1`, and the AMI ID is correct and public. |
| **Cognito errors on login/signup** | Double-check your Cognito App Client ID, User Pool ID, and Client Secret. |
| **API not reachable** | Check security group rules, EC2 instance status, and that PM2 started the Express app. |
| **Frontend can't reach backend** | Make sure the ALB DNS name is set correctly in `/frontend/api/axios.js`. |
| **Terraform apply fails** | Run `terraform init` again, and confirm your AWS credentials are correctly set using `aws configure`. |
